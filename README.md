## Business needs
**Central Valley Engineering & Asphalt, Inc.** is a regional construction leader specializing in placing asphalt, concrete, grading, and underground utilities. Central Valley Engineering & Asphalt, Inc. operated the same website for almost two decades. With advancing technology and the rise of social media, Central Valley Engineering & Asphalt, Inc. needed to redesign its website to align with the goals of the business and the target audience.

## Solution
The new website was designed to:
- be user friendly and mobile device friendly
- encourage more users to become customers through a more professional and robust interface
- give the customer all the information they need while they are in research mode and entice them to call when they are ready to make a deal

## Frontend Technologies
To maintain snappy loading speeds while using the React framework, I chose to use the GatsbyJS Static Site Generator. This website was my first experience with animation and I used this project as an opportunity to learn the Framer Motion framework. Lastly, this project was also one of my first experiences with TailwindCSS and I believe it made me a much more efficient developer. I enjoy how easy it is to remember the various utility classes and I extracted components when I found myself reusing classes.
- React
- TailwindCSS
- Framer Motion
- GatsbyJS

## Backend Technologies
While most of my backend experience is with Express, I decided to use this project as an opportunity to learn the new Fastify framework. I created two API endpoints that send emails to **Central Valley Engineering & Asphalt, Inc.** whenever a user submits the contact form or the request a bid form.
- Fastify
- Nodemailer
